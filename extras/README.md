# Bash Scripts

Following are bash scripts that I have found helpful when dealing with lots of aws profiles.

bash_aliases - commands to use the aws-env utility and ingest the exported variables.

bash_aws - Case state to visually represent transition to another aws profile

bash_func - unset aws command and bash prompt.
